            <p>There are many types of color schemes, each gives a website a 
                different feel. Here are a few common types:</p>

            <h3 class="body-head">Complementary</h3>
                <p>A complementary color scheme is one that uses two colors 
                opposite of each other on a color wheel. It can also include 
                relevant tints if more than two colors are needed. A 
                complementary color scheme offers the most color contrast of any
                color scheme.</p>
                
                <h3 class="body-head">Analogous</h3>
                <p>Analogous color schemes can be created by pairing one color 
                with two of the colors next to it on a color wheel. If you need 
                a five-color scheme to just three, you can add two more colors 
                to the color wheel. Analogous color schemes are softer and have 
                less contrast making them an alternative choice to monochromatic
                schemes. Use an analogous scheme when you want to create an 
                emotional or aesthetic color scheme such as one that represents 
                the ocean or the Fall season.</p>
         
                <h3 class="body-head">Triadic</h3>
                <p>Triadic color combinations offer high contrast color schemes 
                with a consistent tone. Triadic color combinations are made by 
                using three colors equally spaced around the color wheel. A 
                Triad color scheme is great for creating high contrast between 
                colors in a design but in order to create some variation, the 
                colors should be chosen in different tints so that they do not 
                sit in line when a circle is drawn around the color wheel.</p>
        
          
                <h3 class="body-head">Split Complementary</h3>
                <p>Split complementary schemes include one dominant color and 
                two colors that are adjacent to the complement for a 3-color 
                palette. This allows for a more nuanced palette while keeping 
                the high-contrast benefits of complementary colors.</p>
         
            
            
                <h3 class="body-head">Rectangle</h3>
                <p>Also known as a tetradic color scheme. A tetradic colors 
                scheme is in the shape of a rectangle on 
                the color wheel. The rectangle color offers a subtler approach 
                to color selection than its square counterpart.</p>
            
            
            
                <h3 class="body-head">Square</h3>
                <p>In a square colors scheme or diamond-shaped color scheme, 
                four colors that are equal to each other on a color wheel are 
                selected. This scheme creates two sets of complementary colors 
                that add significant contrast to a design, much more than the 
                rectangular version.</p>
